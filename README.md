# HS-projects

All the projects in this repo were done in high school-- when I was first introduced to programming. 

Projects in this folder were also created using NetBeans, some of them are GUIs, while others simply print to the system's output.

easterDateApp: GUI that tells you the exact date easter will fall fall on when given a valid year.

hiLoGame: A GUI version of the classic high-low game. The computer picks a random number and you guess the number, with every turn you're told if your guess was too high or too low.

nameApp: GUI that prints out whatever name you input backwards and in 'Last Name', 'First Name' mode.

slopeCalc: GUI calculator that gives you the slope when given two points.

teleConverter: GUI that converts letters to their corresponding telephoe numbers (i.e a,b,c = 1 and t,u,v = 8).
